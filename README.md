In this repository you will find the files that were used in the video.
You will find the following files:

1.) 3D_world.world
This is the world file in which you will run your Husky made by me.

2.) Husky_3D_world.launch
This is the launch file required for running the 3D_world.world in Gazebo.

3.) Husky_3D.launch
This is the file we will be executing and spawning the 3D_world as well as the robot in it.

You will find all other files installed along with the Husky.
